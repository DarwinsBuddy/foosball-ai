This software is designed to take a camera feed or a video file as an input of a match played
on a foosball table (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ Wuzzler), track the ball and count goals.

## Features

* Support for different streaming backends ([imutils/opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html), [VidGear](https://abhitronix.github.io/vidgear/latest/)) for capturing
* Preprocessing
  * arUco marker detection for roi estimation and cropping to improve performance
  * goal detection build on top of arUco detection (done every other second to compensate table movement)
* Ball tracking
  * frame-by-frame analysis of rgb/bgr stream
  * ball detection by color masking (can be calibrated for different ball colors)
  * ball track (adjustable length) to analyze later on
* Analyze
  * [X] detect goals on either side
  * [ ] TBD: detect middle goals (they won't count in ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ tavern rules)
  * [ ] TBD: estimate ball speed
* Hooks
  * `playsound` providing support for playing a sound on ðŸ“¢ goal ðŸŽ‰
  * webhook support for triggering something different (or counting goals on a [separate](https://github.com/5GS/foosball) [system](https://github.com/5GS/foosball-ui))
* Rendering
  * optional, since `headless` mode is also supported
  * show detected goals, basic stats, ball track, current score
  * [ ] add VidGear streaming support to live stream

## Prerequisites
* python3

1. Activate venv  
> ```#!/bin/sh  
> . ./venv/bin/activate  
> ```
2. Run camera calibration
> ```#!/bin/sh  
> python3 -m foosball -c cam -cv <path-to-calibration-video>.mp4
> ```
3. Run
```#!/bin/sh  
python3 -m foosball -f <path-to-file>.mp4
```
## Misc
### Calibration
#### Color
Color calibration is needed for the ball (or the goals) to be detected.
There are 2 preconfigured ball profiles and 1 goal profile available, accessible
by a cli option. For individual options please refer to the calibration mode where you can select the color range to 
be detected and stored in a color profile accordingly.

> `ball`/`goal` calibration mode
> ```#!/bin/sh  
> python3 -m foosball -f ./demo.mp4 -c [ball|goal]
> ```

#### camera (aruco)
1. Generate Aruco Board
   > ```#!/bin/sh  
   > python3 -m foosball -a
   > ```
2. Print it in DIN A4 format (`aruco.png`)
3. In order to automatically detected the aruco markers and thus
improve performance and accuracy, for each camera an initial calibration has to be done.
Once run this application with calibration mode `cam` and present the printed out version of
the generated aruco board to the camera by
- waving it sturdily in different angles in front of the camera,
- provide the path to a pre-recorded version of it
- or provide a path to a set of pre-recoded images of it

>`cam` calibration mode
> ```#!/bin/sh  
> python3 -m foosball -c cam -cs 50
> ```
